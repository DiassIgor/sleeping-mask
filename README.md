# Sleeping Mask Project

This project will be divided in two parts:
  1. Oura Ring Analysis
  2. Sleeping Mask Validation

## 1. Oura Ring Analysis



## 2. Sleeping Mask Validation

The usage of the EOG signals for predicting the REM during the sleep can be validated with the Oura Ring Data. In addition, its possible combine another features extracted by the Oura Ring to improve EOG analysis. 

Above the set of measures in Oura Ring that is possible useful:
  - Bedtime Start
  - Bedtime End
  - Awake Sleep Time
  - REM Sleep Time
  - Light (N1 or N2) Sleep Time
  - Deep (N3) Sleep Time
  - Heart Rate Measure (Lowest, Highest and Average)
